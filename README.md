# NoisyOptimisationWithStochasticAnnealing
Noisy Optimization with Optimal Stochastic Annealing.

This is an implementation and proof of concept of the algorithm "Optimal Sampling for Simulated Annealing Under Noise".
This algorithm was developed by Juergen Branke and Robin C. Ball, and compared against other commercial algorithms by me.
The comparison was performed in the scope of the independent Final report for the MSc in Mathematics for Real-World Systems, Centre for Complexity Science, University of Warwick.
